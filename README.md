# Feature Engineering

In this top-up, you will be guided to how todo  __Feature Engineering__ using the [palmer penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) üêß dataset that you find in the data folder. 


## Set up your Environment

Please make sure you have forked the repo and set up a new virtual environment. For this purpose you can use the following commands:

The added [requirements file](requirements.txt) contains all libraries and dependencies we need to execute the Logistic Regression notebooks.


### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 


- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-Bash` CLI :
    ```
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

The data used in this notebook is saved in the data folder
```

*Note: If there are errors during environment setup, try removing the versions from the failing packages in the requirements file.*
